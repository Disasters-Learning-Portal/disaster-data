    "title": "OCO-2 MIP Top-down CO\u2082 Budgets v1",
    "description": "This dataset contains top-down annual net land-atmosphere fluxes of CO\u2082 on a 1-degree grid for a six-year period (2015-2020) from an ensamble of atmospheric CO\u2082 inversions, as well as annual bottom-up estimates of fossil fuel emissions and lateral carbon fluxes due to crop trade, wood trade, river export and cement production. Annual changes (loss) in terrestrial carbon stocks are obtained by combining top-down and bottom-up estimates. The standard deviation for each variable is provided (std). IS layers assimilates in situ CO\u2082 mole fraction measurements from an international observational network. LNLG layers assimilates CO\u2082 measurements from the ACOS v10 algorithm which uses land nadir and land glint total column dry-air mole fractions observed by the OCO-2 satellite. LNLGIS layers assimilates both in situ and ACOS v10 OCO-2 land nadir and glint retrievals together. OG layers assimilates CO\u2082 measurements from the ACOS v10 algorithm using OCO-2 ocean glint retrievals. LNLGOGIS assimilates all sources together (in situ (IS), OCO-2 ACOS v10 land nadir and land glint (LNLG), OCO-2 ACOS v10 ocean glint (OG)). Data is provided in units of grams of carbon dioxide per square meter per year (g CO\u2082/m2/yr). The source dataset is titled Pilot top-down CO\u2082 budget constrained by the v10 OCO-2 MIP Version 1 and can be found at https://doi.org/10.48588/npf6-sw92",
