    "description": "The Vulcan version 4.0 data product represents total carbon dioxide (CO\u2082) emissions resulting from the combustion of fossil fuel (FF) for the contiguous United States and District of Columbia. Referred to as FFCO\u2082, the emissions from Vulcan are also categorized into 10 source sectors including; airports, cement production, commercial marine vessels, commercial, power plants, industrial, non-road, on-road, residential and railroads. Data are gridded annually on a 1-km grid for the years 2010 to 2021. These data are annual sums of hourly estimates. Included is the estimated total annual FFCO2 for the United States, as well as the estimated total annual FFCO\u2082 per sector in units of metric tonnes of carbon per 1 km x 1 km grid cell per year (tonne C/km2/year). The Vulcan Project is a multiagency (NASA, DOE, NOAA, NIST) funded effort under the North American Carbon Program (NACP) to quantify North American fossil fuel carbon dioxide (FFCO\u2082) emissions at space and time scales much finer than has been achieved in the past. The purpose is to aid in quantification of the North American carbon budget, to support inverse estimation of carbon sources and sinks, and to support the demands posed by higher resolution FFCO\u2082 observations (in situ and remotely sensed). The detail and scope of the Vulcan FFCO\u2082 inventory has also made it a valuable tool for policymakers, demographers, social scientists and the public at large.
