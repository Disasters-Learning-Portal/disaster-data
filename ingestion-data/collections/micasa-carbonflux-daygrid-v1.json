    "description": "This product provides estimated daily carbon flux to the atmosphere from net primary production (NPP), heterotrophic respiration (Rh), wildfire emissions (FIRE), fuel wood burning emissions (FUEL), net ecosystem exchange (NEE), and net biosphere exchange (NBE) derived from the Más Informada Carnegie-Ames-Stanford-Approach (MiCASA) model. All model calculations are driven by analyzed meteorological data from NASA's Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Application, Version 2 (MERRA-2). The resulting product provides global, daily data at 0.1 degree resolution starting from January 2001. The carbon flux variables are expressed in units of kilograms of carbon per square meter per day. MiCASA is an extensive revision of the CASA – Global Fire Emissions Database, version 3 (CASA-GFED3) product. CASA-GFED3 and earlier versions of MERRA-driven CASA-GFED carbon fluxes have been used in several atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO₂) transport studies, serve as a community standard for priors of flux inversion systems, and through the support of NASA's Carbon Monitoring System (CMS), help characterize, quantify, understand and predict the evolution of global carbon sources and sinks.",
