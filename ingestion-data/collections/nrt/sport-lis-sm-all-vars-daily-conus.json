    "description": "The NASA SPoRT (Short-term Prediction Research and Transition Center) Land Information System (LIS) provides comprehensive soil moisture data products that support disaster monitoring and response efforts across the contiguous United States. These high-resolution datasets, available at approximately 3-kilometer spatial resolution, offer daily updates on both relative and volumetric soil moisture conditions at multiple depths using advanced land surface modeling techniques. Relative soil moisture products represent current soil water content as a percentile compared to historical records, while volumetric soil moisture percentiles are calculated against a 33-year climatology (1981-2013). The collection includes surface layers (0-10cm) that respond rapidly to short-term weather events, intermediate layers (0-40cm, 0-100cm) that balance short-term and subsurface responses, and deep layers (0-2m, 0-200cm) that capture long-term trends. These products enable disaster coordinators to quickly identify areas experiencing abnormally dry or wet conditions, supporting assessments of drought severity, flood risk potential, wildfire danger, agricultural stress, and post-disaster recovery monitoring. Distributed in Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) format, the data integrates seamlessly with GIS platforms and web-based mapping applications, providing emergency managers, agricultural specialists, and water resource managers with near real-time intelligence for informed decision-making during critical disaster preparedness and response operations.",
