    "description": "The NASA SPoRT Land Information System (LIS) 0-40 cm Soil Moisture Percentile product provides daily maps of shallow subsurface soil moisture anomalies across the contiguous United States at ~3 km resolution. Percentiles are calculated against a 33-year climatology (1981-2013) to place current soil conditions in historical context. This cumulative layer combines the 0-10 cm and 10-40 cm depths, making it responsive to short-term precipitation, snowmelt, and drying episodes while still reflecting intermediate soil storage. Compared to the 0-10 cm layer, the 0-40 cm depth responds more gradually, with anomalies typically evolving over several days. This product is especially useful for drought onset monitoring, agricultural decision support, and fire-weather risk assessments, where short-to-intermediate timescale soil responses are most relevant.",
