    "description": "The NASA SPoRT Land Information System (LIS) Volumetric Soil Moisture Percentile products provide daily assessments of soil wetness conditions across the contiguous United States at approximately 3-kilometer resolution. Percentiles are calculated against a 33-year climatology (1981-2013) to show how unusual current soil moisture values are for the given day of year. This collection includes multiple soil depth layers (0-10cm, 0-40cm, 0-100cm, and 0-200cm), each responding to precipitation and drying at different timescales. Surface layers (0-10cm) respond rapidly to short-term weather events, making them useful for fire risk and flash drought monitoring. Intermediate layers (0-40cm, 0-100cm) balance short-term surface changes with slower subsurface responses, supporting agricultural and hydrological applications. The full column layer (0-200cm) captures long-term drought and groundwater trends. These products are widely used by agencies contributing to the U.S. Drought Monitor and support disaster monitoring, agricultural decision-making, and water resource management.",
