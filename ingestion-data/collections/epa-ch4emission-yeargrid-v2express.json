    "description": "The gridded EPA U.S. anthropogenic methane greenhouse gas inventory (gridded GHGI) includes spatially disaggregated (0.1 deg x 0.1 deg or approximately 10 x 10 km resolution) maps of annual anthropogenic methane emissions for the contiguous United States (CONUS) from 2012 - 2020, consistent with national annual U.S. anthropogenic methane emissions reported in the U.S. EPA Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks (U.S. GHGI). This dataset contains methane emissions provided as fluxes, in units of megagrams of methane per square kilometer per year (Mg CH₄/km²/yr). It contains 34 data layers including a 'Total' layer with emissions fluxes from all anthropogenic sources of methane in the U.S. GHGI; 6 aggregate layers with emission fluxes from Agriculture, Natural Gas, Petroleum, Waste, Industry, and ‘Other’ source categories; and 27 layers representing methane emission fluxes from individual sector categories (i.e. the individual layers that make up each of the aggregate layers and the 'Total' layer). The data have been converted from their original NetCDF format to Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) and scaled to Mg/km²/yr for use in the US GHG Center, thereby enabling user exploration of spatial anthropogenic methane emissions and their trends. The source data and addition information can be found at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8367082",
