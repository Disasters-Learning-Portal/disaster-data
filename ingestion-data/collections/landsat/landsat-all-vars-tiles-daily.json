    "description": "NASA Landsat satellites provide continuous Earth observations since 1972, capturing multispectral imagery across visible and infrared wavelengths. This collection includes multiple visualization products: true and natural color composites, color infrared for vegetation analysis, and calculated indices like NDVI for vegetation health, NBR for burn severity, and MNDWI for water detection. These products support environmental monitoring, disaster response, agriculture, and land cover mapping.",

It is calculated using a ratio of near-infrared (NIR) and shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands, which are affected differently by fire, with higher NBR values indicating less damage and lower values indicating more severe burns. The difference between the pre-fire and post-fire NBR, known as the differenced NBR (dNBR), is used to map burn severity.",
