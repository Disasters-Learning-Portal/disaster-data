    "description": "This dataset provides global gridded, daily column-averaged carbon dioxide (XCO₂) concentrations from January 1, 2015 - February 28, 2022. The data are derived from Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) satellite observations that were input to the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) Constituent Data Assimilation System (CoDAS), a modeling and data assimilation system maintained by NASA’s Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO). Concentrations are measured in moles of carbon dioxide per mole of dry air (mol CO₂/mol dry) at a spatial resolution of 0.5° x 0.625°. Data assimilation synthesizes simulations and observations, adjusting modeled atmospheric constituents like CO₂ to reflect observed values. With the support of NASA’s Carbon Monitoring System (CMS) Program and the OCO Science Team, this dataset was produced as part of the OCO-2 mission which provides the highest quality space-based XCO₂ retrievals to date. The source data can be found at https://doi.org/10.5067/Y9M4NM9MPCGH",
