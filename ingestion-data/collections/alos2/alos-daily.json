    "description": "The Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2 (ALOS-2, DAICHI-2) is a follow-on mission from the ALOS Daichi. ALOS has contributed to cartography, regional observation, disaster monitoring, and resource surveys, since its launch in 2006. ALOS-2 will succeed this mission with enhanced capabilities. JAXA conducted research and development activities for ALOS-2 to improve wide and high-resolution observation technologies developed for ALOS in order to further fulfill social needs. These social needs include: 1) Disaster monitoring of damage areas, both in considerable detail, and when these areas may be large 2) Continuous updating of data archives related to national land and infrastructure information 3) Effective monitoring of cultivated areas 4) Global monitoring of tropical rain forests to identify carbon sinks.",
