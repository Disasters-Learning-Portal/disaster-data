    "description": "Wetland methane emissions in units of grams of methane per meter squared per day (g CH₄/m²/day) produced by the Lund–Potsdam–Jena Dynamic Global Vegetation Model (LPJ-DGVM) Wald Schnee und Landscaft version (LPJ-wsl). LPJ-wsl is a prognostic model used to simulate future changes in wetland emissions and independently verified with remote sensing data products. The LPJ-wsl model is regularly used in conjunction with NASA's GEOS model to simulate the impact of wetlands and other methane sources on atmospheric methane concentrations. Data is provided in 0.5° resolution from January 1, 1980 to December 31, 2021. The source data can be found at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6964918. As of April 2024, this dataset has been replaced by an updated version in the US GHG Center titled Wetland Methane Emissions, LPJ-EOSIM Model v2 (STAC id: lpjeosim-wetlandch4-daygrid-v2).",
