    "description": "This dataset presents a variety of carbon flux parameters derived from the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford-Approach – Global Fire Emissions Database version 3 (CASA-GFED3) model. All model calculations are driven by analyzed meteorological data from NASA's Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Application, Version 2 (MERRA-2). The resulting model output provides monthly, global data at 0.5 degree resolution from January 2003 through December 2017. It includes the following carbon flux variables expressed in units of kilograms of carbon per square meter per month (kg Carbon/m2/mon): net primary production (NPP), net ecosystem exchange (NEE), heterotrophic respiration (Rh), wildfire emissions (FIRE), and fuel wood burning emissions (FUEL). This product and earlier versions of MERRA-driven CASA-GFED carbon fluxes have been used in a number of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO₂) transport studies, and through the support of NASA's Carbon Monitoring System (CMS), it helps characterize, quantify, understand and predict the evolution of global carbon sources and sinks. The source dataset can be found at https://doi.org/10.5067/03147VMJE8J9. As of April 2024, this dataset has been replaced by an updated version in the US GHG Center titled MiCASA Land Carbon Flux v1 (STAC ids: micasa-carbonflux-daygrid-v1 and micasa-carbonflux-monthgrid-v1).",
