    "description": "The land Surface Disturbance product (DIST) maps disturbance detected when there is a change outside a historical norm using optical or SAR imagery. The DIST suite is composed of complementary products, which are named according to their input datasets. Specifically, a separate DIST product is generated from Sentinel-1 and the Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS) data. The products are designed to share the same structure, GeoTiff file format, file-naming convention, and have posting of 30 m. All products are accessible through the Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center (LP DAAC).",
