It is calculated using a ratio of near-infrared (NIR) and shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands, which are affected differently by fire, with higher NBR values indicating less damage and lower values indicating more severe burns. The difference between the pre-fire and post-fire NBR, known as the differenced NBR (dNBR), is used to map burn severity.",
